Description: Download certificates from public sites for use on private sites.
 Sometimes a LetsEncrypt certificate is desired to be deployed in a private
 environment, like an office or home use for servers that are not publicly
 reachable. Due to the private nature of the server, LetsEncrypt cannot validate
 the domain using the 'well-known' file mechanism. In cases where DNS validation
 is not an option offsite-cert could be helpful.
 .
 The offsite-cert program just downloads the LetsEncrypt certificate from a
 publicly reachable server, that itself just uses one of the standard ways of
 retrieving a LetsEncrypt certificate. Offsite-cert extracts the certificate
 from the standard SSL communication and therefore does not need any special
 access to the public server. The only step needed is that the server admin has
 to copy the LetsEncrypt private key during setup time from the public server to
 the private server. From then on only the regenerated certificates are needed.
 .
 See the manpage for installation details.
