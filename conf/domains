# This is the offsite-cert configuration file

# Empty lines, lines containing whitespace only and lines starting with a '#'
# as first non-whitespace are ignored. All other lines shall have 3 space or
# tab separated record containing:
#
# <server:port> <target domain> <destination file>
#
# <server:port>     is the server to connect to. This server usually is a
#                   webserver that serves the target domain.
# <target domain>   is the domain whose certificate is to be retrieved. In many
#                   cases that will be the same as the server in <server:port>.
#                   In case the <server> serves the <target domain>, but the
#                   <target domain>s IP is different from the <server>s IP,
#                   offsite-cert will contact the <server>s IP but still get the
#                   certificate of the <target domain>.
# <destination file> is the file location where the downloaded certificate is
#                   copied to. The certificate will only be copied, if it either
#                   is not present at the destination or its content has
#                   changed.

# Examples:
# example.com:443   example.com         /etc/nginx/ssl.cer/example.com.crt
# example.com:443   www.example.com     /etc/nginx/ssl.cer/www.example.com.crt
